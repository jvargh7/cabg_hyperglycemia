# Pathway level information can inform us on the question on which pathways are involved.

# Taking the top features and then annotating the top 10-100 features can identify metabolites 
# that may not fit in any common pathways, or identify novel metabolites that are unknown.

# Doing pathway analysis first allows us to get a better snapshot of what is occurring within 
# central metabolism, and can start informing us on where to focus our attention. 
# Doing individual annotation first helps to identify central metabolites, but not 
# necessarily if theyâ€™re involved with metabolism. 

# To question B, the simple answer is yes, but the complicated answer is more complex. 
# So I used 4 databases to query the dataset as a whole for both columns, KEGG, 
# the human metabolome database (HMDB), Lipid Maps, and the Toxin and Toxin Target Database (T3DB). 
# Depending on your interest, many other databases exist or can be created, such as the 
# Food Database as one example, and I've designed several databases regarding specific 
# metabolites of drugs for other studies.

 # In my shared folder, i have a file that says full annotation which are the 
# annotations using the 4 above databases, with each database separate and a file 
# that I made to merge the results. You all should have access to these files

# Mummichog, the software used for pathway analysis, was designed to use only 
# KEGG and the edinborough database which is nested within the software, 
# though that may change in future updates.
